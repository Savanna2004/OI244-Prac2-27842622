Practical Group: 1
Neighbourhood: photography
Total Marks Available: 40
Warning: this week's assignment is a lot more work and will take you at least 4h to complete.

Background

In this practical assignment, you will start designing a website that you will come back to and make further modifications to over a number of practical classes.

In the 1990s, quite likely before you were born, the World Wide Web was a very different place, and in its youth, there were significantly fewer places where you could develop an online presence without being a large business. Social media had not yet been invented, and web browsers couldn't yet offer interactive content in the way that they can today. Due to the complexity of hosting their own sites, a lot of hobbyists chose to have a small personal website hosted by another provider. The largest and most famous of these providers was a company called GeoCities which offered a place for people to host sites organised approximately by topic with an index so that you could explore these sites. Remember, this was before Google! At the end of the 1990s the company was bought by Yahoo, who operated it for another decade before shutting it down in 2009. The Japanese language version of the site lasted significantly longer and was only terminated in 2019!

Your task for this week's practical is to develop a personal website for a hobby, passion, sport, or anything else that fits in one of the 29 categories, or Neighbourhoods, that GeoCities provided. To start, you will need to learn more about the 29 neighbourhoods and GeoCities as a whole on Wikipedia at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_GeoCities. Next you can select a neighbourhood, and then a topic that falls under one of the topic areas of your neighbourhood.

NB: You don't choose a neighbourhood and then create a web page for the neighbourhood, rather you choose a topic that you are interested in and then fit the neighbourhood to that topic. For example, if you'd like to create a web page about the popular video game Baldur's Gate 3, you'd select Times Square as your neighbourhood.

You will build a modern website on the topic you have chosen. If you desire, you can also incorporate some silly, but fun elements from the early web, such as marquees or blinking text.

Assignment Instructions

Start by deciding on a topic and the neighbourhood that you will make a site for. Like last week, others will see your site, so be sure that you are comfortable about sharing the material with classmates, tutors, and the lecturer.

Update this README.md file to insert your student number, practical group, and the selected neighbourhood on lines 1-3.

[10] Start by making a home page. The file should be called index.html and should contain a full-blown HTML page with some introductory content about the topic you've chosen. You possibly want to add a picture or two. (Note that in this module, you can use resources and pictures from the Web freely but be sure to add a comment in your HTML with a reference to the source to avoid plagiarism. DO NOT copy text that someone else has written.)

Format your content using suitable HTML tags. Consider using things like headings, paragraphs, lists, images, etc. Explore new tags from the HTML reference material available on SUNLearn.

[20] One page does not make a website. Add two more pages to your site. These could be on any topic but should be relevant for the content. They need not contain masses of text if you put other types of content on them. Some ideas could include an image gallery, a page with a large table (you'll need to work out how HTML tables work) of stats, or even just a contact us page (maybe with a (visible but non-functional) form?). The opportunities are endless.

[5] Add some links to the top or bottom of each of your pages to form a menu. You could put them in a list, or separately, but make sure you can browse between each of the three pages.

[5] Add some structure. We will learn in class about semantic content tags which you should use to separate the parts of your page. If you'd like to get a head start, you can read about them in the docs. We are talking about things like header, footer, section, aside, and nav (for a non-exhaustive list).

Make sure you've tested everything using the python web server and viewed it in the browser. Remember you can go back and look at your assignment from last week any time if you need guidance.
